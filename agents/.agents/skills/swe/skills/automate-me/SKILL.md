# Automate me

A guided flow for turning the user's working conventions into a skill agents will follow. The output is one `-mode` skill tailored to them (e.g. `jay-mode`, `priya-mode`).

This skill orchestrates three others: an inline mining pass (see step 1), your harness's skill-authoring skill (authoring), and the **unslop** skill (prose discipline). It sequences them. It doesn't replace them.

Use the existing skill-creator skill for authoring and evaluation. References to `create-skill` below mean skill-creator.

## Flow

### 0. Check for an existing skill

Look for an existing personal mode in the project and shared `.agents/skills` directories. Confirm which skill to update when the request is ambiguous; do not create duplicates.

- Update the existing skill (default for repeat runs)
- Start fresh (rare, ask why before doing it)

Update mode changes the rest of the flow:
- Step 1 mines only history since the skill was last edited (`git log -1 --format=%cI <path>`).
- Step 2 asks what's changed or missing, not what to capture from zero.
- Step 4 edits the existing file in place. Preserve sections the user hasn't contradicted. Revise ones with new evidence. Add new sections only for genuinely new rules.

### 1. Mine their history

Locate the active workspace's transcripts before fanning out. Use only that workspace's directory. Don't glob across every project's directory. That crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects. Where they live depends on your harness:

Use the active harness's history API to identify the current project and its relevant thread history. Read only explicitly scoped conversations; never sweep unrelated projects or infer liveness from transcript timestamps.

Survey recent agent conversations within that scope for recurring patterns. Run multiple parallel subagents across slices of history (e.g. last 2-4 weeks, split into 3 slices so each has enough material). Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **swe** skill. Each slice mining subagent reads transcripts from the workspace-scoped path the parent provides, looks for the signals below, and returns a short structured list of patterns it saw with evidence pointers. Default signals worth hunting:

- Response preferences (length, tone, format, "dumb it down" corrections)
- Delegation habits (subagents, models, specialized workflows, parallelism)
- Verification posture (what "done" means, unit tests vs live repro, reviewers)
- Code and prose discipline (style, principles cited, lint/format tools)
- Process conventions (worktrees, commits, PRs, review/merge tooling)
- Meta preferences (fixing skills mid-task, proposing new ones)

Cross-check across slices before elevating a signal. Patterns seen in 2+ slices are high-confidence. Lone signals are weak and usually get dropped.

### 2. Ask the user directly

Ask the user about intent not demonstrated in the scoped history. Offer choices in chat when they clarify a real preference.

Ask one or two focused questions, then allow the user to add missing preferences in their own words.

Don't dump 20 questions.

### 3. Cluster findings

Group the combined signals into sections. Common ones (use only what applies):

- **Response style**: length, tone, format.
- **Autonomy**: how much to do without asking, MCP tool use.
- **Understand first**: which skills to reach for when scoping or investigating a change.
- **Subagents**: default, parallelism, model-to-task, specialized workflows.
- **Prose / code discipline**: principles, lint tools, style guides.
- **Review and verify**: repro posture, verification skills, live-testing tools.
- **Process**: git worktrees, commits, PRs, review/merge tooling.
- **Skills**: skill-authoring habits, fix-the-skill-first, proposing new skills.

The **swe** skill shows the shape. Read it for granularity. Don't copy its content. The user's rules are not the same as swe's.

### 4. Draft the skill

Use your skill-authoring skill (`create-skill`) to author the skill. Placement:

- Path: preserve an existing mode skill's category. For a new mode, use `<skills>/<handle>/<handle>-mode/SKILL.md` when the repo has an established personal category for that handle. Otherwise default to `<skills>/<handle>-mode/SKILL.md` in the project, or the user-level skill folder if the user prefers a personal skill. `<skills>` is your harness's skill folder from step 0.
- Handle: the user's first name or chosen identifier.
- Frontmatter `description`: trigger on their name + `/<handle>-mode` + "work in their style", not on generic keywords like "write code" or "review PR".
- Frontmatter formatting: follow `create-skill`'s YAML rules. Keep `description` as one YAML scalar. Quote it or use `description: >-` with indented continuation lines when punctuation or wrapping requires it.
- Frontmatter `disable-model-invocation: true` by default. Opt out only if the user explicitly wants their mode to apply on every turn.

### 5. Iterate on prose

Apply the **unslop** skill and `create-skill`'s writing guidelines to every line.

Show the draft to the user and take feedback. Expect multiple iterations. Cut ruthlessly. A mode skill is not a manual.

### 6. Land it

Work in a worktree off main. Commit and open a PR. Don't push to main directly.

## Guardrails

- **Don't overfit to one conversation.** A preference stated once and contradicted another time is noise. Require multiple instances before codifying it.
- **Don't be clever.** Restating other skills' contents, inventing metaphors, or writing "poetic" prose for an agent reader is cost without benefit. Keep it operational.
- **Reference, don't inline.** Other skills the user relies on should appear as path references, not pasted excerpts. Same for any principle docs they maintain elsewhere.
- **Keep sections minimal.** Only add a section if the user has a specific, non-default rule there. "Communicate clearly" is not a section. "Short paragraphs. Tables when comparing options. Bullets only when items are genuinely parallel." is.
- **Name conventions generic.** Use "the user" or "the human" in imperatives, not the author's first name.
- **Don't force symmetry.** If a user has no process rules worth writing down, skip the Process section entirely.

## Evaluation

A `-mode` skill is subjective output. A `create-skill`-style test/iterate benchmark loop isn't useful here. Vibe-check with the user: does it read like them? Did it miss anything? Then ship.

Run a description-optimization loop only if the skill's trigger accuracy turns out to be a problem in practice.

## When not to use

- User wants a task-specific skill (not working conventions): `create-skill` alone, no mining required.
- User wants to capture one narrow workflow (e.g. "how I write commit messages"). That's a regular skill, not a mode skill.
